<h1>Mayank Mishra</h1>
<p>I am a computer science undergraduate from University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, India and am currenlty working under the guidance of Dr. Tanupriya Choudhury on various research projects. I am also advised by Mr. Tanmoy Sarkar, lecturer of , professor of Food Processing Technology at West Bengal State Council of Technical Education for creating a classifier to detect food products with possible allergens. </p>
<p>I am mostly interested in the field of Computer Vision and Deep learning. I wish to deploy robust and generalizable computer vision systems that can aid in the advancement of social groups currently marginalised by integrating the domains of language and knowledge representation. </p>
